# Inscape Live Data Chart
This is an abstracted version of the live data chart originally on the Inscape 2017 site. The intention of this module is to keep the module isolated from the rest of the project

## Usage
For a production-ready responsive build of this chart
```
npm run compile
```
This compiles the JS and SCSS into `/dist/bundle.js` and will render when included on a page with `<div id='app'></div>`

## Development
To run a local isolated dev server
```
npm start
```

## Install
With [npm](https://npmjs.org/) installed, CD into the directory and run
```
$ npm install
```
